# Resolve .crypto Without Libraries

In this tutorial, we will look at resolving Unstoppable Domains, using nothing but HTML, Javascript, and the ethers.js library.

{% hint style="info" %}
Unstoppable Domains offers a total of 10 different namespaces.: .crypto, .nft, .888, .x, .blockchain, .bitcoin, .wallet, .coin, .dao

The .zil namespace is located on a separate chain and requires different instructions. 
{% endhint %}

Each of them can be resolved in exactly the same manner as the .crypto we are showing below.

![Dynamic GIF showing the steps to resolve a .crypto domain](../.gitbook/assets/crypto-resolve.gif)

To resolve an unstoppable domain, we will need to

* Tokenize the domain
* Configure Ethers.js library
* Make a call and fetch the data

Let’s visualize the resolution process using some of the simplest tools a web developer has: knowledge of `HTML` and `javascript`.

## Initialize the project folder <a id="e120"></a>

The first thing we need to do is create a folder with three files inside: index.html, index.js, and ethers.js.

```text
$ mkdir crypto-resolution
$ cd crypto-resolution
$ touch index.html index.js ethers.js
```

Your project folder should look exactly like the following:

```text
.
├── index.html
├── index.js
├── ethers.js
```

### Build the Layout: Index.html <a id="f889"></a>

Let’s open the index.html file and build out the layout for our app. To create a positive UI experience for the user, we’ll need to build an input bar, a button to trigger the resolution, and a `<div>` to display our records.

Next, we’ll need to connect [js-sha3](https://www.npmjs.com/package/js-sha3) \(so that we can use the keccak\_256 hash function\) and [ethers.js](https://docs.ethers.io/v5/getting-started/) to communicate with the blockchain contract.

{% hint style="info" %}
We will need the keccak\_256 hash function to calculate ERC-721 token ID for the **unstoppable** domain. To see a full description of this process, read our [Namehashing article](../domain-registry-essentials/namehashing.md).
{% endhint %}

```text
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
    <head>
        <meta charset="utf-8">
        <title>Basic .crypto integration</title>
    </head>
    <body>
      <div id="main" style="
      display: flex;
      flex-direction: column;
      height: 100vh;"
      >

        <input id="input" />
        <button onclick="resolve()">Resolve</button>
        <div id="records" style="display: flex; flex-direction: column;">

        </div>
      </div>

      <!-- This exposes keccak_256 hash function -->
      <script

        crossorigin="anonymous">
      </script>

      <!-- This exposes the ethers.js library as a global variable: ethers -->
      <script src="https://cdn.ethers.io/lib/ethers-5.0.umd.min.js"
        type="application/javascript"></script>

      <!-- This are our custom files -->
      <script src="ethers.js"></script>
      <script src="index.js"></script>
    </body>
</html>
```

### Add some JavaScript: Index.js <a id="c4de"></a>

Now that we have our index.html file set up, let’s add some javascript. We can start by inputting some basic code into our index.js file to capture the text from the input field and print it onto our console. 

The code snippet below shows the resolve function:

```text
async function resolve() {
  const userInput = document.getElementById("input").value;
  console.log({ domain: userInput });
}
```

{% hint style="info" %}
We can open `index.html` in a browser to make sure everything is connected and launches.
{% endhint %}

## Tokenize Your Domain by Namehashing <a id="9004"></a>

Namehashing is an algorithm that tokenizes your domain name in a way that the .crypto smart contract can understand.

To tokenize our domain, we’ll need to split the domain name by the “.” character into separate labels, reverse the array, and reduce it to a single hash. We can do this by implementing a recursive hash function.

We’ll also want to implement an `arrayToHex` function to get the result as a string, as well as a wrapper function namehash.

```text
function namehash(name) {
  const hashArray = hash(name);
  return arrayToHex(hashArray);
}
function hash(name) {
  if (!name) {
      return new Uint8Array(32);
  }
  const [label, ...remainder] = name.split('.');
  const labelHash = keccak_256.array(label);
  const remainderHash = hash(remainder.join('.'));
  return keccak_256.array(new Uint8Array([...remainderHash, ...labelHash]));
}
function arrayToHex(arr) {
  return '0x' + Array.prototype.map.call(arr, x => ('00' + x.toString(16)).slice(-2)).join('');
}
```

Here is the list of expected results with some inputs:

![Namehash examples with different inputs](../.gitbook/assets/namehash-examples-diff-inputs.png)

## Configure the Ethers.js library <a id="abe0"></a>

To talk with any blockchain contract using `ethers.js`, we need to know the following:

* Contract address
* Contract ABI
* Ethereum provider

Let’s add the following information to our **ethers.js** file:

```text
var address = '0x299974AeD8911bcbd2C61262605b89F591a53E83';
var abi = [
  {
    constant: true,
    inputs: [
      {
        internalType: 'string[]',
        name: 'keys',
        type: 'string[]',
      },
      {
        internalType: 'uint256',
        name: 'tokenId',
        type: 'uint256',
      },
    ],
    name: 'getData',
    outputs: [
      {
        internalType: 'address',
        name: 'resolver',
        type: 'address',
      },
      {
        internalType: 'address',
        name: 'owner',
        type: 'address',
      },
      {
        internalType: 'string[]',
        name: 'values',
        type: 'string[]',
      },
    ],
    payable: false,
    stateMutability: 'view',
    type: 'function',
  }
];
var provider = ethers.providers.getDefaultProvider('goerli');
```

{% hint style="info" %}
The contract address and the network is from the goerli testnet. If you want to configure your project for mainnet you should use the following contract address: [**0xfEe4D4F0aDFF8D84c12170306507554bC7045878**](https://etherscan.io/address/0xfee4d4f0adff8d84c12170306507554bc7045878#code) and network **mainnet** instead of **goerli**
{% endhint %}

For the scope of this project, we will only need to use the getData function from the [CNS Smart Contract](../domain-registry-essentials/cns-smart-contracts.md#proxyreader).

### Create a Contract Instance

Next, we’ll need to create a contract instance and create a function to query our contract.

```text
var contract = new ethers.Contract(address, abi, provider);
async function fetchContractData(keys, tokenId) {
  return contract.getData(keys, tokenId);
}
```

By inspecting the contract’s getData function interface, we can see that it requires from us an **array of keys** and a **tokenId**. We can get the **tokenId** by calling the **namehash** function from above.

{% hint style="info" %}
Although any string can be stored as a key under the domain, Unstoppable Domains has [standardized the keys](../domain-registry-essentials/records-reference.md) across many applications.
{% endhint %}

### Record Keys Lookup

For this tutorial, we will be looking up the following records:

![Records keys and description for each](../.gitbook/assets/records-keys-descriptions.png)

## Make the call to the contract <a id="2047"></a>

Let’s update our resolve function to use the namehash and then look up the desired record keys from the input domain name. We’ll then want to print the result in the console to inspect in more detail.

```text
async function resolve() {
  const userInput = document.getElementById("input").value;
  const tokenId = namehash(userInput);
  
  const interestedKeys = [
    "crypto.BTC.address",
    "crypto.ETH.address",
  ];
  
  fetchContractData(interestedKeys, tokenId).then(data => {
    console.log({
      ownerAddress: data.owner,
      resolverAddress: data.resolver,
      records: data[2]
    });
  });
}
```

If we try to resolve the **brad.crypto** domain with the above keys, we should see the following parsed result from `fetchContractData` function:

```text
{
  "ownerAddress":"0x8aaD44321A86b170879d7A244c1e8d360c99DdA8",
  "resolverAddress":"0xb66DcE2DA6afAAa98F2013446dBCB0f4B0ab2842",
  "records":[
    "bc1q359khn0phg58xgezyqsuuaha28zkwx047c0c3y",
    "0x8aaD44321A86b170879d7A244c1e8d360c99DdA8"
    ]
}
```

{% hint style="info" %}
data\[2\] is an array containing all resolved records in the same order in which they were queried. In this case, the first argument is a BTC address and the last one is an ETH address attached to the domain.
{% endhint %}

## Display the Records <a id="a0c8"></a>

Since this is a simple example, we won’t get too fancy. We’ll just create a span element for each record containing its key and value, its owner address, and its resolver address. We’ll also want to set the font to red if the record is not found.

```text
function cleanDOM(parent) {
  while (parent.firstChild) {
    parent.removeChild(parent.firstChild);
  }
}
function displayResolution(resolution) {
  const {ownerAddress, resolverAddress, records} = resolution;
  const mainContainer = document.getElementById('records');
  cleanDOM(mainContainer);
  const ownerRecord = document.createElement('span');
  ownerRecord.innerHTML = `ownerAddress: ${ownerAddress}`;
  const resolverRecord = document.createElement('span');
  resolverRecord.innerHTML = `resolverAddress: ${resolverAddress}`;
  mainContainer.appendChild(ownerRecord);
  mainContainer.appendChild(resolverRecord);
  Object.entries(records).map(([key, value]) => {
    const recordSpan = document.createElement('span');
    if (!value) {
      recordSpan.style.color = 'red';
      value = `No ${key} found`;
    }
    recordSpan.innerHTML = `${key} : ${value}`;
    mainContainer.appendChild(recordSpan);
  });
}
```

Before we test it out, let’s make our lives a little easier by implementing a function to combine keys and results into one object.

```text
function combineKeysWithRecords(keys, records) {
  const combined = {};
  keys.map((key, index) => {
    combined[key] = records[index];
  });
  return combined;
}
```

Now we can easily show the records on our page:

```text
fetchContractData(interestedKeys, tokenId).then(data => {
    displayResolution({
      ownerAddress: data.owner,
      resolverAddress: data.resolver,
      records: combineKeysWithRecords(interestedKeys, data[2])
    });
  });
```

If we are successful, we should see the following on our page:

![Example of a successful resolution](../.gitbook/assets/example-successful-resolution.png)

## Set-up Error Notifications <a id="d38b"></a>

Now that we have made a successful call, let’s deal with all possible errors that might come up during the resolution.

To do this, we’ll want to create a function to place an error in our records div. We’ll also want to add a boolean argument `cleanDom` to remove everything from the records div before we place an error for display.

```text
function displayError(message, cleanDom) {
  const mainContainer = document.getElementById('records');
  if (cleanDom) {
    cleanDOM(mainContainer);
  }
  const error = document.createElement('p');
  error.style.color = "red";
  error.innerHTML = message;
  mainContainer.appendChild(error);
  return ;
}
```

We can easily identify the possible errors by playing around with the app in its current state. The following table displays possible errors and descriptions for each.

| Errors | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| Domain is not registered | Owner address is `0x00000000000000000000000000000000` |
| Domain is not configured | It is possible that owner address exists but resolver address is set to `0x00000000000000000000000000000000` |
| Record is not found | Records are queried for an address \(e.g. crypto.BTC.address\) but the domain owner hasn't set  up the records yet |

Once we’ve identified the errors, we will need to update the callback to the `fetchContractData` function to show the errors to the user:

```text
function isEmpty(msg) {
  return !msg || msg === '0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000';
}


async function resolve() {
  const userInput = document.getElementById("input").value;
  const tokenId = namehash(userInput);
  
  const interestedKeys = [
    "crypto.BTC.address",
    "crypto.ETH.address",
  ];
  
  fetchContractData(interestedKeys, tokenId).then(data => {
    if (isEmpty(data.owner)) {
      displayError('Domain is not registered', true);
      return ;
    }

    if (isEmpty(data.resolver)) {
      displayError('Domain is not configured', true);
      return ;
    }

    displayResolution({
      ownerAddress: data.owner,
      resolverAddress: data.resolver,
      records: combineKeysWithRecords(interestedKeys, data[2])
    });
  });
}
```

Now you can resolve any .crypto domain and display the appropriate error message to your users. Just open the index.html file in your browser and play around with the results to get a better sense of the types of errors that may come up and the types of error messages you might want to include.

For example, you can try to resolve the following domains:

| Domain | Result |
| :--- | :--- |
| udtestdev-creek.crypto | Domain has no BTC record |
| udtestdev-test-btc-record.coin | Resolves without any issues |
| udtestdev-johnny-dev-domain.coin | Domain has no BTC record |
